### Welcome to [Frobulator](https://frobulator.app)

Frobulator is a custom shell parser and scripting function library: Frobulate all the things!

Frobulator is easy to use and understand and is meant to help streamline your shell scripting projects while providing you with:

- Colorized prompts
- Line header markers for various message types
- Standardized 80 charcter line parsing and splitting
- Standardized user input prompts
- Streamlined file and directory commands
- POSIX-compliant and BASH-based scripting commands and functions
   - Customized Debian-based system commands (i.e.: apt/aptitude package commands)
   - Streamlined package management functions that declutter your scripted setups for the most commonly used apt/aptitude commands
   - Dependency functions that simplify package requirements being fetched for all your scripting and project needs
   - Countdown and progress items to add to your scripts
   - Customizable password obfuscation prompts
   - Script checkpoint solutions to interate over only failed elements or modules
   - Streamlined archive detection and extraction routines
   - Clean ogging, redirection and silencing functions for pretty execution and informed debugging

...all while making redundant and complex code bits a thing of the past!

### Note:

Frobulator is meant to be used (for now) within scripts only, as the currrent set of assertions it is built upon will not permit it to function outside of one.
